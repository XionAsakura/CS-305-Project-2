#  CS-305 Project Two: Secure Software Practices â€“ Artemis Financial  

This project was completed as part of **CS-305: Software Security** at Southern New Hampshire University. The client, **Artemis Financial**, required enhancements to their software to protect sensitive financial data and ensure secure communications. This repository contains my refactored code and documentation addressing encryption, certificate generation, and security testing.

##  Project Overview  
Artemis Financial wanted to modernize its web application by adding a file verification step and enforcing secure communications. To meet these requirements, I:  

- Recommended and implemented an appropriate **encryption algorithm cipher**  
- Generated **self-signed SSL certificates** using Java Keytool  
- Refactored code to deploy a **cryptographic hash algorithm** with checksum verification  
- Converted application communication from **HTTP to HTTPS** for secure data transfer  
- Conducted **static testing** with OWASP Dependency-Check and verified no new vulnerabilities were introduced  
- Performed **functional testing** to validate that the refactored code executed without errors  

---

##  Tools & Technologies  
- **Java** (Eclipse IDE)  
- **Maven** with OWASP Dependency-Check plugin  
- **Java Keytool** for certificate generation  
- **HTTPS / SSL** configuration  
- **Checksum verification** for file integrity  

---

##  Skills Demonstrated  
- Application of **encryption algorithms** and secure coding practices  
- Hands-on experience with **SSL/TLS certificate management**  
- Refactoring and deploying code to enhance **data security**  
- Conducting **static and functional security testing**  
- Applying **industry best practices** in secure software development  

---

## Deliverables  
- Refactored Java project with integrated security features  
- **Practices for Secure Software Report** (includes screenshots, justification, and analysis)  
- Self-signed certificate (`.cer`)  
- Dependency-Check output report  

---

 This project highlights my ability to apply **real-world software security practices**, improve application security through cryptography and secure communication, and validate those changes through rigorous testing.
